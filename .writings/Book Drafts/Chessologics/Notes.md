Unoppinionated principles for playing chessologic games.
Fundamentals

###1. The path of reversing the flow from certainty to uncertainty, would bridge past and future. We aim at building a theory starting from the principle of winning ― a working & successful theory ― where we consider what we want and work to find the conditions of it.

###2. Checkmate is overwhelming influence, that cannot be escaped ― inevitable―. (1) one cannot checkmate if one doesn't surround, is half of the measure toward implementing the overwhelming-condition. Influence on the king's head is the second half and can be either a check or double check, but one can never build more influence due to the obligation of the king to evade these states. The options available to the king in a check-state are, (a) to flee, (b) to remove or (3) to interpose. All these are to remove such influence.

###3. In surrounding one is to use his own pieces to cover adjacent positions to the king or lure the king to a position where its own pieces become a hinderance to its mobility. The checking piece, unless removed, controls one or more such adjacent positions. That is for me why the possibilities to consider are only checks; they reduce the freedom of the king. When combined with inescapability, they confine and kill the king. [All act must be convergent to this.]

###4. (2) one cannot checkmate if there is an escape. Some squares when attained by the king make the task of mating impossible or undermine your checkmating process ― we are no more in a sequence of death ―, such squares are escape points. They point to a direction of fleeing. And speaking about flee directions, there is generally a certain number according to the situation of the king. In decreasing number of possible flee directions they are, (a) close to the center, (b) edge and (c) corner.

###5. Following some direction, one may have many alternatives to escape; different escape point are possible. What can we say about this? A move, within the power of the employed device, can both check and cover an escape point, but cannot do any more, as in covering another escape route ― unless that route is along the action of checking ―, implying that the latter direction is a sure escape and we are outside the domain of checkmating.

###6. One important skill is to be able to tell if a checkmate is possible or not, judging by the current configuration.

###7. Starting from the basic situation, were there is no escape, adding more influence around the king (checking) forces him into diminishing number of freedom until death follows. Where there is one escape, all checks have to cover the escape, is a primary criteria of move choice at this point. With two possible escapes along the same direction, one cannot cover both while checking. Suppose they are along different directions, there is only one way to work this out and that is to have the direction of checking cover the escape and that works only if both directions are along the same line. At three escape directions, it becomes no longer possible to checkmate. The number two is critical and delimits the two phases of the game.

###8. Do I have enough influence to checkmate? If no, what is needed? My first reactions to this is to say that, it strongly depends on the local landscape. But one thing is clear, there is always a piece to deliver the final blow. One to completely overwhelm (<surround+check>) ― unable to employ anti-check measure ― the king.

###9. A game is a crafted puzzle from the conflict of two players trying trying to deliver a check―mate. One cannot craft if one cannot disassemble the craft. As it is known of any kind of craft, there is stages, each characterized by its own method aiming at its completion.

###10. To say that there is checkmate means the reduction of escape to a manageable number (generally one, can be two) of points per play. Only under this condition one has to pursue checking, if one got the right influence, for the purpose of delivering the fatal blow. Such influence has but one purpose, overwhelm. ####10.a. The immediate effect of checking is to force the play and most often that implies the king's relocation. You shouldn't chase the king is no mate, as you will make that task harder as he will get far from where your pieces, or influence is, unless you are deliberately leading him somewhere and that somewhere should be nonother than his doom and in this case mate is possible. ####10.b. To tell if you have enough to checkmate is of great importance when it comes to making a final judgement. [I can't help but think that this study (about mate logics) should be piece-dependent and would rely on understanding basic forms and what are the roles played by each piece.] ####10.c. The possible meanings of the various moves you can enact during a sequence of death are, relocation of the king or the influence, or relocate influence so as to hinder the king.

###11. If influence was complete, there would be no motion, literally nothing to do. It is the fact that influence isn't, that there is flow and motion makes the flow shift around. At any turn you might find a sequence, a threat to you wanting, you just need to be actively watching.

###12. Even though we didn't workout fully the principles of estimation of influence, a necessary condition that separates a forced situation ― one where a player is actively exploiting a found sequence of death ― from the situation that is not. Within the previous point I described a solid method to lead a forced phase to closure, it is to say that the aim now is to bring the flow of the game toward such situation, that is, to realized the necessary condition for the process of checkmating. The principle that fulfills that aim will be the guiding answer for the preforced phase. Before going after such principle there one last bit to extract. To checkmate comes without being checkmated first. When you have a mate-sequence available to you to exploit yet your opponents has the same but is faster, his ability to converge is better and will win over you. This comes from the zero-sum game aspect. And so from this we derive another important factor which is, initiative. Holding your initiative is enough to make it to victory even if your king is in a bad shape.

###13. What is initiative? Its principles and how to play for it? To initiate is to start, to cause a change so that everything happening afterward would be but a consequence. It is the power to effect change and whoever holds it alters things according to his terms. To get the opponent to play as a reaction to your move means you hold initiative. Each player would want to set his own terms as both compete for the same objective and if one gets, that denies it to the other automatically. ####13.a. A mistake is a play that would cost you to be mated or betters the conditions of mating for your opponent relatively to yours. ####13.b. The king's condition should be assessed carefully before anything. That assessment is just an estimation of how close your opponent is to fulfill surrounding and gathering enough influence. The preforced phase interests are position (surrounding) and material deployment and gain (influence), and their consideration with respect to the king's situation tells us about the tempo (initiative). As in the transition to and even within the forced phase, everything is decided by initiative.

###14. At this point of the inquiry, and where all previous development was based on a single principle, that lead us to a known trichotomy of strategic elements already known, yet this time we derived them methodically.

###15. What are the ways through which initiative is maintained? To initiate is to force. One absolute forcing move is check which is the main tool during the forced phase. Another way is to threaten an important piece or to take an advantageous square. The threat produces reaction depending on how the other player values things. The best threat comes by figuring out the opponent's methods and target the means for his end. What is moved is always for a purpose and those which move have but one purpose that is, to mate. (a) Neutralize the attackers as they pose a direct threat, (b) leave the idle pieces idle, these didn't bother to move and so have no purpose, don't give them one, and last (c) target for the most active pieces because their failing is failure to close.

###16. What makes the value of a piece is its capacity to see the board. The idea is to put it where it radiates the most of its influence. Another deciding factor about value is proximity to the ally king. The single purpose of the pieces around the king is to protect him and any other use can endanger him. This clears out the purpose of the pieces far from him as their job is to close toward the other king. /A beautiful symmetry where the kings on the tables act like poles of attraction./

###18. Can we say that the aim o the preforced phase is to close-in (on the king) with enough influence before the same gets done to us? I suppose that resumes the previously sought preforced condition (in contrast to the forced condition ~ checkmate principle) to which we have to say a method is lacking.

###19. Concerning the interaction of influence with its opposition, we advance that it follows a certain calculus. What is meant by influence is the control exerted by pieces over squares or positions and the fact that we have two players, the board is a container of two opposing substances each capable of influence. If the influence of these substances cross on a square we have the following cases, (a) it is symmetric (equal) in which case both are equally controlling the spot, and (b) asymmetric (unequal) in which on has more influence. The influence value is a matter of counting the involved piece in that square.

###20. During a game it is inevitable that opposing influences come into contact. When a piece has an opposing piece in sight, it can capture it. Capture means removal of influence and adding it into your own arsenal (unexpressed influence - dormant power) so you can use it later as your own. This creates an unbalance (logistic asymmetry) regarding the material, where one has more to attack and another less to defend. Losing influence is not good unless it is done in the context of maintaining initiative and forcing a form with a mate in view. Other than that, losing influence go against achieving the "sufficient influence"-condition.

###21. The inevitability of contact and the question of "how to not lose value?", ultimately leads to speak about exchanges as it is the natural compromise between the two ― where pieces are traded instead of simple capture. The calculus evoked in (19.) is about exchanges. We will still have the question of even in exchange, which piece is more valuable? Value is a situational aspect where factor like piece type, proximity to the king, role within the formation and expressed influence, all combine to say something locally valid. Trading close value pieces is a fair trade ,but most often their relative value is not that easy to determine. Fair trade doesn't mean nothing changes; influences will be simplified from the board and a new situation arises where values are reallocated. All of this can be hard to keep track off but is clear is that all that matters is the outcome, and so I say, outcome is the best evaluation.

###22. What can happen during a preforced phase? and how does it affect the conditions of that phase? During a turn you can either move or drop a piece which means that all you do will affect the position aspect of the game. Each move rewrites the relative value of the pieces. Only during a move one can capture another piece (material gain) or promote his piece improving its mobility and reach (influence gain). A play can be either a move or a drop. And what is sought here is a method of play, a mean to deliver the mate. Since such mean takes justification in its own end, it cannot be just an excuse but also a commitment toward fulfilling the end. Each play must lead to a situation where your formation close-in on the enemy king with enough influence to overwhelm and fast enough to not be outdone at the same game. What we can say is that each play affects the whole board, and to be precise it affects different parts with a varying impact (generally most of the effect is focused locally where the move was play but nonetheless we have delocalized effects on various parts keeping the balance of the situation). Whole-board perception is a must in order to integrate all the relevant knowledge in an assessement.

###23. To recap, we got a position, a map of opposed influences, a network of values. A play would affect the influence of the pieces and thus rewrites the values of the network. Being able to read the values from a position is the first step. The value of the piece is its potential combined with its actual influence.
To read value is to visualize the actual influence along with the possibilities accompanying it, that is done by moving the pieces mentally.
To find an interesting play, consider possibilities arising from the from the given position and combine it with [some idea of selection I gave Modern chess theory.]
Make use of a criterion (derived from your answer to the fundamental purpose/question) to judge the worth of the possibilities and rule out the least favorable. ── To not compromise your king's safety. ── Realizing the conditions of transition. ── To gain influence. ── To build form. ── To maintain initiative.
Calculate outcomes of chosen moves.
Compare and take the outcome that has much affinity with fulfilling your conditions of transition. ####23.a. We so far distilled three aspects of play being, form, influence and initiative. These aspects are recognized by an order of importance that differs whether we are in the forced or the preforced phase. During the former, we have by decreasing order initiative-influence-form. Initiative is everything at this point and it is quite simple to demonstrate as if you play a non-check move during a mate-sequence that might give the king an escape, even if it doesn't let's say for the sake of being comprehensive, that only that the opponent is way behind implying that you are relatively ahead (too much initiative that you can afford some waiting moves). During the latter, we have by decreasing order, form-influence-initiative. The very principle of transition requires the right form as a first condition to go into forced situation and a derivative of the principle of mating (+ other complementary condition). Form is more important at this level as both initiative and influence are spent to craft it. We notice from the previous paragraph that we have a quite interesting theory of about the dynamic of game aspects. At first we got a time to develop before first contact, we spend that initiative to create form and then even after contact and exchange we still spend initiative although we don't dispose of much of it because we start playing in reaction to and so we also spend influence to generate more initiative in order to make form. Once we achieve the right balance between all aspects (transition principle), we move two second phase where we employ influence to maintain initiative and at the same time maintain an escapable form to the point where we make it overwhelming.
Conclusion: Influence mediates between form and initiative. Which makes quite sense, as influence is but the potential of material realized and form and initiative are but properties of material.

###24. To better understand the transition, we see the change in the order of aspects yet we notice that influence is conserved throughout the game. The transition INITIATIVE→FORM in normal flow means that tempo should be spent for positioning and in the reverse flow is to maintain tempo via positioning.

###25. The purpose and principle of a play, is transition from a position to another. A play relies on the possiblity of possibilities. A play comes generally with a threat either instantly or remotely. You can threaten a position or a capture, or both. Plays with threat produce initiative. Threats can be either good or bad. Bad threats are to which the answer makes it harder to follow up or to combine. They allow the opponent to build himself with a justified tempo. Good ones force compromises so that you maintain any of the advantages and offers up the possibility to combine. The strongest threat you can issue is that you will end the game.
Read the transition condition at each position.
Get to know your possibilities.
Spot the threats that improve you transition condition.
Assume possible follow ups and they affect your condition.
Calculate the lines up to where you can visualize clearly.
Think in terms of aspects of play.
Choose the fastest path toward the forced phase.

###26. The end of the prefroced is to transition to the forced. Thus the principle behind each play is to achieve form, with enought influence and leading initiative that would lead to overwhelm.

###27. The key to make better play is to become aware of your possibilities and possibilities of your possibilities. What is wanted from each play to transition in favor. Positions arise from the contributions of both players and it is very hard to forced something without being obvious to some extent that is why I suggest to be direct and choose the shortest route.

###28. FORM: is the structure built out of the positioning of various pieces. It is always changing with each play; it is both actuality and potentiality. INFLUENCE: is the control imposed by a piece over the actual position. INITIATIVE: the ability to force an outcome and to be ahead employing threats via adding influence to the current form.

###29. Where there is a threat, there is what is threatened. And that has the following options: (1) remove the threat, (2) to flee from its influence or (3) to interpose and block its influence.

###30. There is some merit to the study off common formations and their effectiveness. Such knowledge would guide our choice of play toward realizing them.

###31. If the forced phase is characterized by check then the preforced is by threats. These have can have the same answers as checks but with extra.

Chessologic Triangle.

Advances
###1. A niche is a square where the king can retreat without being subject to further attacks. It is a rare case where the king doesn't have an escape but still can safe. This may happen due to both the inefficiency of the form or lack/inadequacy of the influence. I had to discern it from the idea of an escape, even though they produce the same effect of making mate impossible or making both our form and accumulated influence meaningless, in an escape the king keeps being mobile, while in resorting to a niche the king is trapped (surrounded) and immobile, yet we are unable to mate it.

###2. The dilemma that a niche puts us in is due to two kinds of inefficiencies: flaws inherent to the form and insufficient (sometimes inadequate) influence. This problem can be approached as designers of forced phases by seeking to compensate the form flaws with sufficient influence [being aware of the king of forms a game can lead to will helps us better the trade choices we make] or as students of various forms by trying to determine the minimum amount of required influence to possess.

###3. Estimating the right amount of needed influence to subdue the king given a certain form should be the kind of basics required from any player This will not only teach estimation of win conditions but also awareness of the flows present in encountered forms.

###4. Flaws in forms can be compensated with the "right" influence, just like how strengths cover weaknesses. This is just me assuming that there is no situation that is a pure flaw ― where no matter the kind of influence at your disposal nothing useful can be done.

###5. With more study, artistic (narrative) roles can be assigned to the pieces. Roles are attributed according to the local situation which through metaphoric thinking is mapped to something recognized in it.

###6. Containment forms ― derive from the fact that all lethal sequences end with a position pattern that successfully contains the king.

###7. In the process of mating the king, it is often helpful to picture the end based on both actuality and possibility and then find a way to realize it.

###8. Containment forms are positional patterns that satisfy the principle of overwhelming influence. Since the number of pieces is finite, the possible combinations we can have to produce these forms is also supposed to be finite. And depending on the type of pieces involved and the shape of their influence, some forms are much more efficient at containment than others. The efficiency is measure as a function of the involved pieces and the shape of the compound influence. The variety of efficiency will induce a situation-dependent interest in the form in question; meaning that depending on the situation of the king, we'd prefer to have certain pieces over others.

###9. What we hope to learn from this new concept might read as follow; since these positional patterns are constructed through a sequence of interaction with the king and its locality, we hope that by knowing what we have at our disposal we can a priori know the possible containment forms which in turn will suggest to us what kind of move to consider.

###10. All lethal sequences end with an overwhelming move ― both surrounding successfully and threatening the king ― and the fact that a kind has to answer a direct threat, it is only the last block of the positional pattern that is threatening naturally implying that other pieces are there to restrain. The pieces in a containment form ought to be connected except in some situations involving the knight.

###11. The type of moves a played in the construction of the previous forms are either to constrain (further) or to bait.

###12. The previous moves won't be possible without the existence of a win condition placement from your side ― your base ― a configuration from which you constrain while remaining connected or bait and profit from the threat that taking the bait would result in the fulfillment of the transition and lead to a lethal sequence.

###13. The factors determining the quality of any chessologic deliberation are: number (of perceived alternatives or option in a given situation), depth (number of moves or the length of lines) and the precision because we humans are limited as to our faculties, visualization being a key aspect of this process projection and deliberation, we will experience "blurriness" as we go deeper in our calculations leading to mistakes and misjudgements.

###14. The first thing or training we propose in order train the skills related to each factor is a training of awareness ― namely the ability to perceive your options given a certain position. We pick any position and we sit on it getting a feel of the board as a whole. (1) identify the position of the king or both, (2) get to know its surrounding pieces and how they control the area, (3) come up with moves (possible ones) along with interpretation of the effect of that move (answer to the why of movement). The point is to be as exhaustive as possible and not missing any possiblity.

###15. The second training is that of depth. We set up a position and then we engage in playing a sequence without touching the pieces. The point is to go as deep as possible until we the blurriness and then we take the pieces and place them according to the constructed image we have of the future position we did reach through this process. Although this might seem as "do until fatigue" type of exercise, one can fix the number of moves and work incrementally.

###16. The last training combines ideas from (14. and 15.). Set up a position and perform (14.) once you get your options and an idea about how to choose from them we perform (15.) then decide by performing (14.) again. The point is to perform calculations while maintaining constant awareness.

###17. The concept of a base [taken from Go] or root of influence occurred to me when analyzing mini-shogi games through the metaphoric lenses that allow me to compare it to hand-to-hand combat where you stance and posture play a huge role during an attack, whether your attack is decisive or at least has a chance at combo'ing is highly dependent on your base. Some pieces can assume the role of a base of influence which anchor attacks through connected support and unconnected baiting.

###18. To phrase tactics in term of fundamental aspects of gameplay, that is, initiative, form and influence, let's consider the idea of development ― advance ― as the exchange of initiative for form. Capture is the exchange of initiative for influence. Exchanges are but a succession of captures.

###19. Thinking about the graphically can lead us to label the different exchanges between aspects in a way that brings forth familiar concepts. [see Chessologistic Triangle] A threat is the usage of your form to produce initiative. A sacrifice or a drop are two ways to convert influence into form.

###20. As we can observe from the triangle, not all conversions are possible. Influence cannot be direction translated into initiative unless it takes form. And form cannot be reverted back to pure influence except through initiative.

###21. Reading the various possible paths through our triangle, we are able to distinguish a good number (if not all) possible strategic action-actions being, sacrifice/drop, capture, threat, development, capture sacrifice, threat capture and sacrifice or drop threat.
Threat capture ― we threaten in a way that we can capture anyway.

###22. The availability of a waiting move (temporisation) is crucial in situations where any other move might cause a disadvantageous unbalance. He who has such option over he who hasn't will witness the other as he puts the rope around his neck and commit to his death or resign to his fate.

###23. Since options stem from the situation at hand, the lines of possible play are obviously based on it as well. If we assign to each line a quality as being either bad or good. A situations is a question that requires an answer, a move. A move is good when all lines stemming from it are good and bad if at least one line is bad.

###24. Situations have in general a mixture of bad and good in them. But situations where whatever one does it is bad have a special name, Zugzwang. They arise when one reaches the limit of his form.

###25. A very peculiar occurrence is when both players assume stances where movement might induce unfavorable unbalance. Here the availability of a waiting move is crucial and decisive. Because moving in Zugzwang is suicide.

###26. The true definition of a waiting move is one that preserves the situation as it is and passes the turn. I believe that there is no pure waiting move when there are moves approximating the behavior by preserving the makes the core of the situation.

Chessologic Actions.

More than anything I believe that understanding the implications of the initial position is crucial to the elaboration of play, as any position yet to come is only a derivation from it through play.

Some give a huge importance to the next move and others see things through positions. These are two perspectives which lead us to great many insights about play. Yet, I'd like invite you to entertain the question, what is the most important thing, the move or the position? If it is the move, then our primary quest is to find the best move, what makes a move the best? can a move even attain that status? If it is the position, then we'd seek a position of strength, a position from which we overwhelm and steer the play to the direction we want. However all of this is meaningless if we don't make it converge toward the single purpose of terminating the game (in your favor of course). And to answer the leading question, I'd say both are important. The reason is that they capture the two crucial aspects, (a) the game is but a long sequence of play where moves connect the various states the board go through, and (b) position, or as I referred to them previously "board states" are but configurations of the pieces in play which got where they got animated by the player's answer to the fundamental purpose and question, how do I terminate this in my favor?. Based on the previous paragraph, a meaningful chess theory is one which provides insights about both (a) and (b).

My process of repertoire making will use the measure by which I determine "how much a move affects me". This measure was chosen specifically to deal with the case of "too much to consider". I will answer only the moves that can affect me significantly and so that will guide my inspection of variations. For this to work I need my play to be efficient that is, fast and sharp. The reason behind this is that I need to assess the meaning of any move using my answer to the fundamental purpose, and if a move doesn't seem to hinder me and I am not working fast enough toward victory then I might find myself in an embarrassing situation. I have to agree that the approach I am describing here is narcissistic to say the least, as I make it only about myself and I intend to be a threat even when the opponent is preoccupied with me by playing most efficiently. "Whether your moves attempt to deal with me or avoid me, I will be a threat, even greater if you avert your eyes so I suggest you try to deal."

Tactical Overlay.
Thesis: it is not important to take the center with your pieces but controlling it with them is.
