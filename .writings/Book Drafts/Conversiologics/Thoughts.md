I read in Venkatesh's book Tempo, that Toyota had a heuristic in order to get to the baseline motive of someone and that goes by asking five consecutive whys. The more we ask it, the more the answer become less sophisticated and close to something trivial. A sophistication the person built to maintain a certain reality.

In a conversation, ask questions. Not any questions. Ask whys, scattered throughout the discussion, disguised in different forms and soon enough we get to the trivial layer. A that level, either $1+1=2$ or $2+2=5$. 

This tactic seems to be worth investigating in cases where you don't know if someone is BS'ing you or not.
