# Simplicity, Clarity and Elegance

Illustration: Triangle Relationships.
Dynamic: Impossible to satisfy all at once.

## Principles of Simplicity
Economy of words. Use the minimum to convey it in full. 
(1) Use shorter word when available (easier and faster to read = better flow). Note[ Make a list of Short vs. Long alternatives]
“Never use a longer word when a shorter one is available.” —George Orwell.
(2) Go for the most commonly used word in a situation.

Cases for breaking the rules: Avoid Repetition, Add Rhythm or Emphasis a Distinction.

Example: Buy vs. Acquire
Buy is shorter and thus preferable. Unless we fall in one of the previous cases. To illustrate the last case, one can buy something without acquiring it, like a gift.

(3) Use fewer words to pass a point. Condensation. 

(4) Avoid Repeating a Point in a Different Way.

Indicators: As I mentioned, As I said, … 
Reasoning: Poor Thinking about the Structure of the Article.

(5) Avoid Over-complicating Things.

Examples: 

Usage of Double Negatives (which forces the reader to go through an extra step of unwinding it in his mind) while A Positive formulation is Possible.

Multiplying entities beyond necessity. Use the minimum words to refer to an entity.[ Word superposition to triangulate an entity. Adds more distinction or construct a complexity.]

(6) Plainer the Better. Avoid Long-winded Ways of Saying Something.

(7) Just what is Needed. Do not Over-explain. Do not Overload with Information. 
The point to be made determines the amount of information to be given by necessity.

(8) Only Keep The Strong Words.
Weak words, do not add much. Some, somewhat, rather, a little, arguably, …	
Redundant words,  do not add anything.
Hedging words, ways of qualifying what you are saying which aren’t necessary. It seems, It appears as though, As it is often said, It is notable, I think, I believe, … 

(9) Never Over-stretch a Thought. Keep it contained. Remove subclauses wherever possible.

(10) Active over Passive Voice.

(11) Avoid Reversing-in to the Idea. Start with Idea.
Instead of saying: “To help this, they did that”, say: “They did that to help this”

(12) Avoid Unnecessary Ceremony at all Levels. Go easy on the capitalization. 

## Principles of Clarity

(1) Overcome Fuzzy Thinking. It will contaminate the expression; bad writing. This happens when the connection between two ideas isn’t well digested. Rephrase is an way which emphasizes the connection.

(2) Avoid Jargon as much as Possible.

(3) Eliminate Ambiguity. Use precise language and narrow the interpretation to what you mean.

(4) Draw Sharp Contrasts. 

(5) Remove Clutter and Word Embellishment. It distracts and gives the feeling that something is escaping grasp or that it is purposefully placed to cover something. It feels like you aren’t being honest. As someone who is honest does its best to be clear.

(6) Be Consistent Using Tenses.

(7) Use Word Modifiers Meaningfully. As modifiers alter the meaning of what comes after them.

(8) Make a Point as Straight as Possible. Curly sentences force readers to have to untangle things in their mind. They stall the comprehension as the reader is trying to obtain clarity through unnecessary gymnastic.

(9) “This” are often used to refer back to something. Its downside is the interruption of the reading flow, especially if one has to check due to unclear reference. Using more specific reference words is better. 

“This” is better at forward referencing while “that” is more backward.

Sometimes you can just remove “That”.

Abusing “This” and “That” is just lazy.

(10) Use “It” to refer to entities and “They” for 

## Principles of Elegance

(1) Develop a Style. A set of rules about presentation which creates an aesthetic. A sense of consistency. Branding.
Use of Capitalization.
Use of Punctuation.
Use of Space and Formatting.
Use Fonts and Sizes.

(2) Avoid Stray Words at the End of Paragraphs that Create Imbalances. 

(3) Have a Principle behind Switching to a New Paragraph. Do not create paragraphs of massively varying size.

(4) Minimize Word Echo. Repetition do sound as if you are running out of things to say. 

(5) Keep Alternatives Handy for often-Repeated Words. It is also best to leave as much distance between them as possible (goes back to 4.)

(6) Separate Ideas as Parallels. Group ideas in a principled manner.

(7) View your Writing as Blocks of Ideas and Organize them to Tell the Most Compelling Story. The points within your blocks must be arranged logically.


                                                                                                    



Writing with the thought of reading.

Words that can be used interchangeably in most cases do have certain contexts which break their symmetry.

Any word that can go, must go.

Sometime it sounds better if you reverse the order.

You can break a rule for another rule. Whichever hightens the beauty is right.

Neat paragraphs reflect clear thinking.
