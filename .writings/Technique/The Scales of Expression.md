Four Levels to Expression
The Scales of Expressions
# Word — Entity

(1) Be Precise

(2) Avoid the Technical and the Abstract.

(3) Avoid Implied Words unless the Distinction is Needed.

(4) Implement Degrees of Orderliness. Words can be groups in theme. 

(5) Avoid Repetition using Reminder Words.

(6) Use Words that Flow into Each Other. Minimize distraction, that is, words that are too odd. 

Pay attention to numbers and capitalized words. Numbers up to nine should be in words while above just are better expressed as numbers. Capitalized words attract attention. Use them moderately.

(7) Emphasize should be in the Structure instead of Emphasizing the Word.


# Phrase — Action

(1) Non-sentences are Interesting Enough to be Used. 

(2) Tighten Sentences. Take the “Hot Air” out! Make it less Loose! 

(3) Sharpen your Expression. 

Generic -> Specific
Ideas, Things -> People

(4) Add Rhythm to Sentences. You can do so by adjusting length, punctuation and structure.

What is interesting about writing is that, even though it is done linearly, it has a sense of direction in that, your style can give a forward or backward feel.
BACKWARD 
- Not only I will do this, but I will also show you that.
FORWARD
- I will do this. I'll also show you that.

Whenever you have two values to play with you can arrange them to produce rhythm. Music is nothing but an arrangement of notes and silences. If you have variation in how these values manifest you can produce nuances of the same thing — different notes and by extensions different silences.

(5) Give a Poetic Flow. A phrase is combination of words. They are composed of syllables which correspond to sounds — notes, some are emphasized during pronunciation — via stress — and the  rest are not.

 That, creates rhythm at the level of the phrase.

Things in 3 are poetic.

(6) Play with Emphasis. The placement of words create emphasis. What is placed first, written first and uttered first, will be the focal point of our understanding.

(7) Bring out the Legitimate Drama to your Writing. Do not underplay your point. Focus on the “action” and the “emotion” of the situation. Bring it to the front!

(8) Do not Go in Different Directions within the Same Sentence. Organize the vectors of your ideas. 

(9) Avoid Back-referencing as much as Possible.

(10) Avoid Ambiguity by Separating Ideas using Punctuation within a Phrase.

(11) 
# Paragraph — Point

(1) Ideas are Better Consumed Compact. 

(2) A paragraph is a unit of attention.

# Text — Narrative

(1) Writers block is the result of two unanswered questions, (i) what is your intention? And (ii) who is your audience?

Why. Phrase your intention = The purpose of your writing
How. Direct your intention = The tone of your writing

Break it down to points that can combine to fulfill your purpose.

Intent: Informative, Persuade, Entertain, Motivate, … 
Audience: General Public, Academician, Left-wing people, …

Intent + Audience = Content + Tone + Pace

Once the questions are answering, you will have a Voice!

(2) List your thoughts as points.

These points can be grouped in many ways. Each choice of a common theme will bring certain ideas together. One can turn that common aspect into a connecting thread to knit together all of these thoughts into a paragraph.

Observe the points and see how they associate; how they interact.

(3) An organization of these points will create a flow. Weave them together. Let them contrast and reinforce each other like a conversation. 

Each ordering principle creates a narrative structure. 

It decides the nature of the writing. What will it be? Opinionated

Or Objective, that is, based on objective standards of understanding the topic.

(4) Start with a Bang[ Anecdotal Device.

What could be other devices to create dramatic tension?]. Get to the Point. Make the Lead as Dramatic as you can.


(5) Leave on a High Note. End with a Cool Kicker.

Circle back to the initial intention.

(6) There are a lot of possible narratives, each to fulfill a purpose. They embed a logic which can be extracted as points and the way build into each other says something about the type of narrative.

Application: Take a text. Express the crux of each paragraph in a sentence. Then see how the sentences build into each other throughout the text. 

Narratives start with Composition,

(7) then there is painting via imagery, analogy and metaphor. To produce form, perspective and color.

(8) Seek Balance and Symmetry at all Levels. Similar words, constant length expression, etc. 

(9)  Sometime you Need to Change the Font Style or Just Print it to Get a New Perspective.
