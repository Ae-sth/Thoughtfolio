The metaphor of birth. The metaphor of sex.

1. Ideas are born in our minds as the product of the intercourse of other ideas.
2. When born an idea tries to branch and connect with well established beliefs for survival purpose.
3. This is what we experience as “connections”, the aha.
4. An idea grows through phases. When birthed it is prone to die at any moment if it doesn’t make itself necessary or useful.
5. What we experience as getting obsessed with an idea is a fight for survival within the mental landscape. 
6. Much like any independent persevering entity, ideas seek immortality. They will try to fuse with the most stable beliefs you have as these have access to significant mental resources.
7. It is about logistics.
8. If you do not condition an idea it will contaminate every aspect of your mindscape.
9. One way of conditioning is to express the idea and see if it survives outside your mind and how.
10. If the idea is resilient enough it will survive in other people too. 
11. Ideas have implicit code. 
12. When put in various situation, the person who has the idea occupying a significant part of his mindscape that is, being an active component of his reality filter, will derive different pieces of knowledge that serve as a local justification for his behavior.

Such is the code, an idea has prescription within it.
13. Expression is a necessity to regulate thought or else one would be limited most to internal conflict. And knowing how hard it is to fight silent battles, internal conflict will bring corruption within the mentalscape and deviation from realistic thought.
