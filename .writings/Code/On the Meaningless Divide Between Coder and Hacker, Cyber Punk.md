It seems to me that any coder should learn the ropes of exploitation so that he knows better. 

Coders and hackers. Makers and destroyers. Good and evil. I say beyond, just like Nietzsche said before.

Be a cyber punk. Not good nor bad, just what you need to be for what you need to do. Whether be it writing an app or exploit to another app. 

You need to know the ins and outs, the possible.

A maker who cannot destroy is a god who can die to his creation. Harness the power of both.
