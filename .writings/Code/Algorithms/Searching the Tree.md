How many times you had a path issue just because you don't know what would be the cwd when you run the code. Now assuming that every file you have in repository has a unique name then shouldn't the name be enough to locate it? Write a `Path` class that would search in repository tree for any item with that name and select it. 

*Now I have justification to make an analog class to URL.*
