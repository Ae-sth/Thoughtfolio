>The more the type system *knows about* your code, **the better it is at helping you**! Once you're fluent in the language of types, **everything becomes possible**. You will no longer feel like the type system restrains your ability to write the abstractions you need.

>By assembling these building blocks (*speaking about the primitives of type-level code*), you will be able to create powerful **type-level algorithms** that make sure the abstractions you create are always used properly in your entire codebase.
