1. The process of doing so will bring you more knowledge.
2. Compared to someone who just produces something sophisticated right off the bat,
3. Such being cannot help others achieve what he did as they have to figure it out for themselves starting from their initial state.
4. Work by iteration and with incremental changes.
5. Re- is going to be attached to every action you do, refactor, repurpose, review ...
6. Each iteration is an opportunity to integrate more knowledge, infuse more cheap tricks, build something that fits quite well and flexible. Compact.
7. You at least start from something. No big jump to make. You can start with anything that works as small as it can be.
8. Growth throughout the process is guaranteed.
9. A good motto for both the learner and the advanced user.
10. Teaches you to fight laziness, the inertia for change. Once you accept this process, coding is not the end. In fact, there is no end. All is mean to achieve an acceptable state for the product.

It has been a while but whatever you are doing, 

> Start with something that works at least, then refine it.

Now, that something can be a miniature version of your product or even the simplest component of its structure. As long as, you understand how it works and why it wouldn't. That is the right place to start from.

The best part is that there are no rules about the which and what to choose as an entry point. It can and it is most certainly different for most people.

The plan from there is to go one addition at a time toward the desired form. No big leaps allowed, except on high dose of inspiration and even then I'd still not recommend it.

Why? You would say.

Well, for the whole period since my last writing, I have been meddling with the design of various solutions, and trust me when I say that this heuristic not only saved me from complicated situation but also contributed to expand my knowledge on the go.

Then, one day I thought why not take it to the realm of my reflections.

First hand, I can say that, whether something works as intended or not is the only truth test of the solution.

Thus, reality doesn't care about how sophisticated is your process.
