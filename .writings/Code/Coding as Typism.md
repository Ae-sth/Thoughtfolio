For a while now, I have been using the TS/ES combination to build various projects. 

The mixture of dynamic typing and type annotations trully comes out as a thing of its own. 

The argument is that type annotations come as compensation for the shortcomings of dynamic typing compared to static.

True. I have much less errors since I started using TS. 
The appeal in coding types not values changes the way coding is done

Principles 
- A type is a set of values.
- Interactions require type compatibility.

Top and Bottom Types - Atomic and Molecular Types - Enums and Generics - Type Converters, Type Assertions and Type Guards.
