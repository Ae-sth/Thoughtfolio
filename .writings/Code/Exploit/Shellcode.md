A small program that is intended to be injected in another running program. This piece of code needs to satisfy a number constraints.

1. Compact. It needs to be small enough to fit into "byte-size" buffers.
2. Position independent. Should not contain hardcoded absolute addresses.
3. Self-contained. Shouldn't reference data in other memory sections. 
4. Polished. Should contain no null characters.
