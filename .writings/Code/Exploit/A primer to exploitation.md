Every code is flawed. We just need to find the angle.

-   Exploit is a piece of Software Code written to take advantage of bugs is an application or software. Exploits consist of **payload** and a piece of code to inject the payload in to Vulnerable Application.

For there to be exploited there needs to be access. The kind of access we need in our current state-of-the-art technology is access to memory aka. *memory corruption*.

To list a number of common vectors of attack we have,
- User input.
- Network port.
- Dependency.
- CLI argument.
- IPC, (if possible, I don't know if we hijack this).

The (ultimate) goal of any exploitation is "arbitrary shellcode execution". That is the optimum case. 

We can have specific non-arbitrary executions, a weak form of exploitation; that could be due to tight security with small exploitation window. 

Don't we have another name for that?

If we think about it, we start from the freedom of what is allowed to be done the machine architecture with an executable, then by having code we impose a structure on top of and along side the already existing essential software pieces.

Now the structure encode with its form a meaning freedom that is representative of the purpose of the program when used by the user. Exploitation vectors exist because the structure fulfills its purpose only when used correctly, thus user behavior is key in this scheme.

If the user wants to use the structure to fulfill its *intended* purpose they will use it as was intended to be used. Yet, the user has more freedom than the system and thus can decide to use something outside of its range usage. Adopt a different interaction with the system that would lead to unknown results, 'unknown' here could be synonymous of 'any' result, that is override the whole purpose of the system and corrupting it.

The image I am trying to paint here is that it is meaningful to see this as a human-machine problem than just-machine problem. Because obviously more structure isn't the solution, as we'll see it is exactly the reason why things can be exploited. So better understand the relationship between humans and machines is the key to build meaningful interactions.
