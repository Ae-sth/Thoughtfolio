Every code is flawed. We just need to find the angle.

-   Exploit is a piece of Software Code written to take advantage of bugs is an application or software. Exploits consist of **payload** and a piece of code to inject the payload in to Vulnerable Application.

For there to be exploited there needs to be access. The kind of access we need in our current state-of-the-art technology is access to memory aka. *memory corruption*.

To list a number of common vectors of attack we have,
- User input.
- Network port.
- Dependency.
- CLI argument.
- Payload between processes.
