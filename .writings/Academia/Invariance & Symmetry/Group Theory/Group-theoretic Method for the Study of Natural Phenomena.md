*Symmetries of the system, understood as #conservation_laws, are mirrored by its differential equations. The symmetries of these equations and their solutions are the formalization of the systems properties. Since there is such direct link between properties or symmetries. I was thinking of substituting the diffeq solving process with the a solution building process. The symmetries tells about the form of the solution.*

*This route start by saying that our solution belongs to a space (of possible solution). Then by imposing symmetry restrictions we are shrinking the space into a smaller class of solutions that has the symmetries we need given the conservation laws of our phenomenon. The final class we get to are solutions that should describe our phenomenon up to the initial conditions of our problem.*

Consider a #phenomenon $F$ modelled by a system of differential equations, $S$. If $S$ has #symmetries then there is exist a group of #transformations of coordinates, $G$ which acts upon the Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}$ associated with $S$ (space of solutions).

The representations, the invariants and covariants of these groups are *related* directly connected with the properties of $S$ which can be translated as properties (as conservation laws #noether_theorem) of the phenomenon $F$.

At the end of the day, solutions (to diffeqs) are nothing but algebraic relations - equations.

Lagrange's and Galois' conclusions on the importance of symmetries regarding the solvability of equations emphasizes the importance of this historical path to appreciate the topic. (See [[Symmetries and Algebraic Equations]])
