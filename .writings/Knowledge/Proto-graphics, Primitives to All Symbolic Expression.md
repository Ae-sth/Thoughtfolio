Proto-graphics, Primitives to All Symbolic Expression

Every technique of recording knowledge—be it a script or a sketch—is constructed out of primitive graphical components and their variation both in shape and size.

I found these primitives to be the dot, the curve and the loop. And from now on I will refer to them as, proto-graphics.

Before going further,…

One might object the premise and argue that formulaic representation like writing is totally different from the graphical kind found in drawing. 

And that is superficially true. My thesis is that both flow from the same source.

The split of representation into formulaic and graphical types is just a projection of our understanding of time and space—respectively—in the act of ordering information.

A text is time-ordered, it flows linearly. 

It only makes sense if you read it in a certain order. You can naturally go back to what you read previously, but that would be more of accessing a memory than reversing time.

To reason about a piece of writing always starts with reading it the way it was intended to be read.

You make deeper sense of a text by exposing the relationships between all you read, the same way you make sense of your life by reflecting on past events.

An illustration is space-ordered, it manifests non-linearly.

There is no favored order nor starting point. Sense-making is akin to exploring an uncharted world. 

There is full access to all expressive dimensions so that content manifests as shapes and relations among them. Space is both a container and a structure, hence non-linearity.

 Each perspective will lead to an interpretation. Each starting point will generate a different reasoning.

Both space and time have been internalized the longest by any human being. These domains are part of our everyday dealings since the day we were born. 

Even if cultures associate different names to these concepts, we can all agree on their fundamental laws as these are unvarying from one experience to another.

In both cases, we order knowledge inspired from these two universally experienced domains. 

Metaphorically, knowledge content is matter. It is coded in strokes, symbols and the various means to visually project distinction.

It shouldn’t be even surprising that one find that the proto-graphics are related in some way to the three generators of human knowedge†.

Dual Correspondence between Protographics and the Iadic principles.

To cast order on matter is to embed meaning. Through that order we intend to communicate understanding. Order is then a mediator of knowing.

We view the canvas—on which we record—as space and the medium—through which we leave marks—as matter.

The whole act of writing or drawing is a metaphor of populating a blank universe with entities of ink. 

This is true whether you “formula”-te or “graphic”-aly illustrate what you know.

Moreover, we attach meaning even beyond order. That is, in the relationship we want matter to entertain with space. Whether we emphasize the former or the latter, the proto-graphics acquire different meanings.

If we foreground space then, (1) the dot, stands for position and singularity, (2) the curve, represents a path or a border between two regions, and finally (3) the loop, refers to an enclosure, a sub-space.

If we foreground matter then, (1) the dot stands for information, a unit of knowledge, (2) the curve represents reasoning and method, a medium of knowledge, and finally (3) the loop refers to a permanent holder of knowledge, a principle or a self-consistent rationale.

Both of the above associations come together to fit within an even more interesting interpretation.

Information (dot) when acted upon or used as a deliberative starting point puts one at a certain position within the proto-space. 

“An abstract dimension. The space of information, of problems and solutions. A world with many worlds within and where metaphors are the way between.” — Self.

A method (curve) will outline a path through this space and defines a distinction as it cuts through it, leaving a mark just as we do when writing.

A logic (loop) is an enclosure within the proto-space ruled by the consistent application of a given rationale.

I invite you to contemplate your own language, the alphabet you use, the images and symbols around you. 

Look at every creative human activity, whether literally or metaphorically, it is all of made out of dots, curves and loops. 

This, I argue is the depth of human expression.

The fact that, we accompany an image or a drawing with a description and illustrate a text with a sketch or a geometric construction, shows how we enjoy variety in representation and the myriad of ways it can stimulate our intuition.

Knowledge recording techniques are nothing but a metaphor to what we experience most, time, space and matter. They are the product of an inspirational process with a long history.
