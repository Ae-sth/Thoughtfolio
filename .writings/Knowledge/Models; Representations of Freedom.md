Many years both studying and searching physics, I can distill both the main question and the technique of physics as describing motion by first defining the freedom and then finding the master constraint.

Extending this method to others areas of human knowledge is a matter of finding a description under which the object of interest is object with freedom. 

Finding a perspective which offers a mode of description as such would enable us to also unify descriptions under the same formalism. A crucial step to posit an all-encompassing theory (in subsequent essays).

In this Freedom formalism, things might have three meaningful values, that is, positive freedom — as in free in the conventional sense of the word and capable of change, null freedom — as in something with no freedom, a constant — and negative freedom — as in being a constraint.

To have freedom, to have no freedom and to lack freedom are the three states things can be at.

To have freedom is to have access to multiple states of being.

A model is a body of description meant to encode both the freedom and constraints of an object. 

Internal model - product of internalization - a mental construction meant to approximate a real object.
External model - product of externalization - a realization of a hypothesized object considered to be possible.
