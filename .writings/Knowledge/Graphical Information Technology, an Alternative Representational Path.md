Graphical Information Technology, an Alternative Representational Path

Throughout history, we, humans and knowledge seekers, have adopted many answers regarding what is fundamental.

People regarded various concepts as primary such as the notion of substance, energy, atom, etc and attempted to explain all the rest as modes and variation of one thing, their chosen epistemic origin.

To say, while all of these were interesting attempts to bring all of our knowledge under one unified notion. Most of them failed. After all, it is no different from choosing a point of view, some will come naturally while the rest will be a challenge.

As I say, “It is all about where you want to shove the complexity.”

Yet among all of these answers about what is fundamental, one stands interestingly strong with little to no shortcoming. In fact it is the one which provided me with the mode of thinking that lead me to say what I quoted above.

In fact such perspective understands that all comes represented and thus with a certain bias in its expression. It forces one to acknowledge the impact of representation and looks beyond to possible representation and what they have to offer.

Such perspective places information as the fundamental unit.

 The word ‘topic’ comes from the ancient Greek term ‘topos’, which means, again, ‘place’.
