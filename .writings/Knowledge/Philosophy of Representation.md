# Philosophy of Representation
1. Representation out any context of use should be worthy of a philosophical investigation.
2. There is enough similarity between the different instances of use whether in physics or literature to conclude that there are principles which apply to all representations.
3. The usage of language to even write about this topic is a form of representation to the knowledge associated to "representation".
4. Representation as an act. Representation as a thing.
5. Knowledge-wise, a representation is a description associated to a particular perception and choice of language.
6. It seems that this is the bottom of it. The thing that cannot be described only through a usage of itself.
