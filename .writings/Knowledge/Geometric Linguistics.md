Geometric Linguistics

The world manifests geometrically. 

Whether it is what we see or something we intuit internally, it is all expressed in term of relations.

The question of how information manifests itself in the various media and tools used by man to navigate the world and exert control over its resources

How does geometry encode information

Geometry comes from man interest in measuring things in reality. Of understanding the rules these measures obey.

That evolved into mathematics, then algebra took the frontend. 

Mathematics is then used as the language of quantitative sciences. 

The deepest insight found in these science is viewing the world from an informational pov.

The linguistics I will attempt to build will emphasizes the informational aspect of figures.

To build a language one must categorize the world and articulate his distinctions through labels. From there, one must forward the logic these categories must obey to be in accordance to what is observed. At last, we combine both categories and logic to construct meaningful phrases to explore 

I’d like to emphasize that all of this is very tentative and purely the product of a personal interest.
Geometric Vocabulary


The point is the most fundamental entity in geometry. All latter figures and forms can be understood as a pattern of points following a given constraint.

Each pattern seem capable of encoding a particular type of geometric information. Considering figures up to 3 points seems to be enough to account for all there.
Geometric Grammar

Geometric Transformations

Translation — transfering length to another location
Rotation — put length on another orientation

Inside two overalapping circles we find a Crossing x Parallel Construction.

Appendix — Geometric Doodling
The other day I looked at my friend sketching a geometric figure without using straightedge+compass and I wondered if there is any value to be found in such activity. 
One must assume that that segments are all diffrent unless they are marked or found to be related via a circle.
