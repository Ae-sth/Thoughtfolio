# Knowledge is an Aesthetical Structure
(and it makes sense, descriptions!)

Premise: Knowledge is nothing but a multi-layered linguistic structure with interdependent vocabularies and grammars. 

Knowledge is nothing but linguistic structure .

A day during my student life, I was standing somewhere high and looking down, I fell in deep thought. We had few minutes in between classes. 

My erring toward grand questions during the teacher’s explanations stuck with me. It lead me to an unusual thought.

“Maybe, there is no content after all.”

I noticed how in practically all domain of human interest, objects are considered as to their form and content. One is coupled with appearance and behavior while the other explain it. Content is most often associated to mechanism and causation.

Physics does so by splitting mechanics into kinematics and dynamics, biology via the study phenotype and genotype, etc.

I could tell that this analytical approach was based on the foreground/background distinction which helps us handle perceptual information and package them in intelligible ways.

Yet, something felt off.

It was obvious to me that, one could apply the same method to parts of the content. Thus effectively making them his/her objects of interest Asking questions about their form and the reason behind it (content).

One can repeat the process for all components and their subcomponents, each time pushing the responsibility of explaining behavior down to deeper parts of the object.

And this is what we have been doing in a search for so-called fundamental elements, primitive; where further composition is impossible. Their behavior is solely determined by external effects, no internal mechanism. 

It the point where there is no further content. Nothing.

This is not the only interesting conclusion one can extract from this disintegration into primitives. The consequence of shoving down the “contentual responsability” until its complete dissolution in favor of external constraint, result in the propagation of form throughout all the levels of the structure.

Form, languague and aesthetics (croche)

Forms are made of primitives we assign meaning to.

Language is built to mimick this structure. Starting from letters, we construct words, phrases and paragraphs.

At the end, knowledge is a structure made of the itneraction of many languages with overlapping vocabularies and grammars. Each tailored to describe certain aspects of the object undder consideration.

(Later thesis: meetaphors are devices to transfer meaning between two similar topics.)

The form/content distnction is useufl in practice. It helps break own the understanding of soemthing, as behavior and internals, effect and cause, interface and mechanism. 

It is often expected that form follows from the interaction of the content with externals, like water in a bottle. Form becomes our way to access  and understand the thing.

Knowledge is that which we attempt to express linguistically.

To some degree we grew to confuse knowledge with what is used to represent it.
